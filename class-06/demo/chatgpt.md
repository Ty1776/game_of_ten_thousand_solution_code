- in python create a GameLogic class for me

```
Sure, here's an example of a GameLogic class in Python:

python
Copy code
class GameLogic:
    def __init__(self):
        self.score = 0
        self.level = 1

    def increase_score(self, points):
        self.score += points

    def increase_level(self):
        self.level += 1

    def game_over(self):
        print("Game over! Final score: ", self.score)
This GameLogic class has an __init__ method that initializes the score and level to zero and one, respectively. It also has methods to increase the score and level, and a game_over method to print the final score when the game is over.

You can create an instance of the GameLogic class like this:

You can create an instance of the GameLogic class like this:

python
Copy code
game = GameLogic()
And then call its methods to update the score and level:

python
Copy code
game.increase_score(10)
game.increase_level()
When the game is over, you can call the game_over method to print the final score:

python
Copy code
game.game_over()
```


- can you give me a dice_roller method inside of a GameLogic class
```
Sure! Here's an example implementation of a GameLogic class in Python with a dice_roller method:

python
Copy code
import random

class GameLogic:
    def __init__(self):
        self.score = 0

    def increase_score(self, points):
        self.score += points

    def get_score(self):
        return self.score

    def dice_roller(self):
        dice1 = random.randint(1, 6)
        dice2 = random.randint(1, 6)
        total = dice1 + dice2
        print(f"You rolled {dice1} and {dice2}. Total: {total}")
        return total
In this example, the dice_roller method uses Python's built-in random module to simulate rolling two six-sided dice. It then calculates the total of the two dice and prints a message to the console displaying the individual dice rolls and the total.

You can create an instance of the GameLogic class and use the dice_roller method like this:

python
Copy code
game = GameLogic()
total = game.dice_roller()
This will roll two dice, calculate the total, print a message to the console, and return the total as a value that you can use for further game logic.

```
