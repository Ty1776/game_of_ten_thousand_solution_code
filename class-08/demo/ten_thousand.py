# Should handle setting aside scoring dice and continuing turn with remaining dice.
    # change the number of dice to roll with
    # call my roller_dice(new number of dice)
    # add some points to the "shelf" current rounds score:
    # validated scored points and add them to the current shelf.
    # validate the dice that are put in for scoring



# Should handle when cheating occurs.
    # Or just typos.
    # E.g. roll = [1,3,5,2] and user selects 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1
    # Should allow user to continue rolling with 6 new dice when all dice have scored in current turn.

    # validate the dice that are put aside are actually in the roll
    # run the validated roll through calculate score




# Handle zilch
    # Round ends = increase the round by 1
    # No points for round, and round is over
    # zero out the shelf (round score set to 0)
    # reset next dice roll to 6 dice




# If you have questions refer to game rules, the online game or ask the client (put in a ticket)
